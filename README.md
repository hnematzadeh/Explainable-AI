These are related data for a conference paper entitled [On the Use of Explainable Artificial Intelligence for the Differential Diagnosis of Pigmented Skin Lesions](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-031-07704-3.pdf)

Due to space limitation in github the data needed to run mel2.py including the saved weights for the model, training and test sets and their labels (in the numpy.ndarray format) are [here]    (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NnSVK3uE_T5zYa2hzrXp9W5MUbtD9ZLk?usp=sharing).
